    <h1> Getting started with GitHub Actions</h1>
    <!--An HTML comment-->
    <p>Before we start playing with <strong>GitHub Actions</strong>, let's have a look at what they are and how do they
        work.</p>

    <p>GitHub Actions work on a basis of <em>workflows</em>. A workflow is a series of jobs that are run when a certain
        triggering
        event happens. The jobs that are run then themselves contain instructions for what GitHub Actions should do.</p>

    <p>A typical execution of a workflow looks like this:</p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Triggering event happens (for example, there is a push to the main branch).</li>
            <li>The workflow with that trigger is executed.</li>
            <li>Cleanup</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h3>Basic needs</h3>
        In general, to have CI operate on a repository, we need a few things:
        <ol>
            <li>A repository (obviously)</li>
            <li>Some definition of what the CI needs to do: This can be in the form of a specific file inside the repository or it can be defined in the CI system</li>
            <li>The CI needs to be aware that the repository (and the configuration file within it) exist</li>
            <li>The CI needs to be able to access the repository</li>
            <li>The CI needs permissions to perform the actions it is supposed to be able to do: For example, if the CI needs to be able to deploy to a production environment, it needs credentials for that environment.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
